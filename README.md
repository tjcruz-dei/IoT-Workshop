# IoT-Workshop
Repository for the Amazing Lab IoT Workshop. 

This repository includes the source code for:
1. An Arduino example, written using the Espressif ESP32 SDK.
2. A Python example, which uses the Eclipse Paho library (Python3)
3. A Python example of a simple real-time visualization

All code snipets are devoid of credentials and IPs, which should be added by the students. Also, both for the Python and Arduino code, *topicSuffix* and *ChanId* must be updated to the same value, which identifies the device in use.
